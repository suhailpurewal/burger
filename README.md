# Burger Homework

## Overview

### The purpose of this program is to keep track of burgers that you have eaten, want to eat, and have created.

### This is a basic one page application. The instructions are below.


## _Main Page_

There are three buttons on this page. When you add a burger via the create button, it adds an entry into the SQL DB. When you click devour, it moves that entry to the devoured category in the DB. Finally when you click delete, it removes the entry from the DB.

#### Create
* You input a burger that sounds tasty and it will move over to the selection of burgers you can Devour.
#### Devour
* When you click devour, the burger moves to the devour column.
#### Delete
* Clicking delete removes the item from the DB. You should now be full!
